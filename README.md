## Advent of Code 2024

### Rust 101

- cargo new <project name> 
- cargo run --bin part1 to run specific bin
- cargo fmt to format code
- cargo test part1 to run part 1 tests

## Structure

- New cargo for each day
- Separate each part in different bins
- Utils also available in bin (make available at root?)
